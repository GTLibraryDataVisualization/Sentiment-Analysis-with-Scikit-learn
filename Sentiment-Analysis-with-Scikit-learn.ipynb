    "## Tools\n",
    "The approach of this project will be based on the implementation of random forests in Python with ML packages including:\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- NumPy\n",
    "- scipy\n",
    "- scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach Overview\n",
    "## Importing the Required Libraries\n",
    "The first step as always is to import the required libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "Let's explore the dataset a bit to see if we can find any trends. But before that, we will change the default plot size to have a better view of the plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "Yelp review can contain many slang words and punctuation marks. We need to clean our data before they can be used for training the machine learning model. However, before cleaning the reviews, we also need to divide our dataset into feature and label sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing Text in Numeric Form\n",
    "Statistical algorithms use mathematics to train machine learning models. However, mathematics only work with numbers. To make statistical algorithms work with text, we first have to convert text to numbers. To do so, three main approaches exist i.e. Bag of Words, TF-IDF and Word2Vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag of Words\n",
    "Bag of words scheme is the simplest way of converting text to numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF-IDF\n",
    "In the bag of words approach, each word has the same weight. The idea behind the TF-IDF approach is that the words that occur less in all the documents and more in individual document contribute more towards classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF-IDF using the Scikit-Learn Library\n",
    "Python's Scikit-Learn library contains the TfidfVectorizer class that can be used to convert text features into TF-IDF feature vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dividing Data into Training and Test Sets\n",
    "In the previous section, we converted the data into the numeric form. As the last step before we train our algorithms, we need to divide our data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the algorithm while the test set will be used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training the Model\n",
    "Once data is split into training and test set, machine learning algorithms can be used to learn from the training data. Any machine learning algorithm could be used here. The Random Forest algorithm will likely be chosen, owing to its ability to act upon non-normalized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Predictions and Evaluating the Model\n",
    "Once the model has been trained, the last step is to make predictions on the model. To do so, we need to call the predict method on the object of the RandomForestClassifier class that we used for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this project a few foundamental concepts will be touched and utilized that can benefit a wide audience:\n",
    "- Preprocess text\n",
    "- Vectorize text input easily\n",
    "- Work with the tf.data API and build performant Datasets\n",
    "- Build Transformers from scratch with TensorFlow/Keras and KerasNLP - the official horizontal addition to Keras for building state-of-the-art NLP models\n",
    "- Build hybrid architectures where the output of one network is encoded for another\n",
    "The sentiment analysis is one of the most commonly performed NLP tasks as it helps determine overall public opinion about a certain topic."
